 Renting a Car:
1. Reservation and Booking: 
    - Users search for available cars based on their rental duration, location, type of vehicle, and specific features.
    - Reservation involves selecting a car, confirming rental dates, and sometimes making an initial payment.

2. Documentation and Check-In:
    - Renters complete necessary documentation, including license verification, insurance, and rental agreements.
    - They may also inspect the car for any existing damages and note them in the rental agreement.

3. Usage and Return:
    - During the rental period, the user can use the car based on the agreed terms and conditions.
    - Returning the car involves refueling, if necessary, and a final inspection to ensure it's in the same condition as when rented.

4. Billing and Feedback:
    - Once the car is returned, the billing process is completed based on the rental duration and any additional charges incurred.
    - Users might also leave feedback or reviews about their rental experience.

Each use case involves a series of steps and considerations, making the overall process comprehensive for buyers, sellers, and renters in the automotive industry.
