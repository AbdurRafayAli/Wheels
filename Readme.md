Use Case Rafay
Buying a Car:

1. Research and Selection: 
    - Users browse through available cars based on preferences such as make, model, price range, features, and more.
    - They might compare different vehicles, read reviews, and check specifications to make decision.

2. Documentation and Financing: 
    - Once a car is chosen, the buyer engages in the necessary paperwork, including registration, insurance, and financing if needed.
    - Financing options might involve loans, lease agreements, or cash payments, each requiring specific documentation and processes.

3. Transaction and Delivery:
    - Finalizing the purchase involves negotiating the price, arranging payment, and possibly scheduling delivery or pickup of the vehicle.
    - This phase often includes a test drive to ensure the chosen car meets the buyer's expectations.
