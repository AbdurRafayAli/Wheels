Selling a Car:
1. Listing Creation:
    - Sellers create detailed listings of their cars, including images, descriptions, specifications, and selling price.
    - The accuracy and completeness of the listing are crucial to attract potential buyers.

2. Marketing and Promotion:
    - Sellers might utilize various platforms—online marketplaces, social media, or dealer networks—to advertise the car to potential buyers.
    - Responding to inquiries promptly and arranging viewings or test drives are key steps in the sales process.

3. Negotiation and Sale: 
    - Negotiations over price, terms, and conditions take place between the seller and potential buyers.
    - Once an agreement is reached, the sale is finalized, involving paperwork and possibly payment transfers.

4. Transfer of Ownership: 
    - Transferring ownership involves legal processes, such as signing over the title, providing a bill of sale, and updating registration documents.
